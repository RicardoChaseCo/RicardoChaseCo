### About Me

<!-- :mortar_board: I'm a final-year engineering student at VESIT (University of Mumbai) <br> -->
:superhero_man: M.S. Computer Science Student at Johns Hopkins University, Full-Stack Web / Mobile Development, AWS Certified Cloud Engineer<br>
:supervillain_man: Besides programming, you may find me at lifting weights, taking care of pets at pets rescue center, and doing road-trip somewhere.<br>
:construction: Recent thoughts: Why finding an intern is that hard, I just want to code, even for free! ; Hiking here at Mclean, VA, in my opinion, is the best thing you can do.
